## Market Analysis  

Market analysis is a vital first step in game development. It helps you understand the industry, identify opportunities, and guide your game’s direction.  

This section also covers how to define your game’s scope based on your team’s size and resources. Aspiring game developers should stay open to adjusting their ideas and embracing smaller, achievable projects. If you truly love making games, you’ll want to take your time. Going straight for your big idea is like taking the fast-food approach. It satisfies your hunger quickly but misses the deeper satisfaction that comes from careful, deliberate creation.
