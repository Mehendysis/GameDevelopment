# Game Overview
A brief overview that clearly explains the game's concept, aiming to remain mostly unchanged once the idea is approved. Further changes should be analyzed but should be welcomed.

---

## Game Description

- **Working Title**
The game's title should be carefully considered and evaluated. Is it already in use by another game? Have you tested it with potential players through surveys or polls? The uniqueness of your title can be assessed by checking the number of Google search results it generates.

- **Tag line**: 
    A tagline is a memorable phrase or statement that brands your game. Not all games have a tagline, and it may feel outdated in some cases. However, when it fits the genre and timing, it can be a powerful branding tool.

    "**Gotta Catch 'Em All!**" – Pokémon

    "**War. War Never Changes.**" – Fallout

- **Platform and Engine**: 
    Describe the platforms the game will be released on (e.g., PC, consoles, mobile) and the technology or game engine (e.g., Unreal Engine, Unity) being used for development, explaining how these choices impact the game’s performance and accessibility.

- **Visual Perspective**:
    Define the game’s graphical style—2D, 3D, or 2.5D—and camera perspective, such as top-down, isometric, side-scrolling, first-person, third-person, or fixed-camera.

- **Genre**:
    You can look up Steam Primary Game Genre or [Wikipedia list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Video_game_genres):

        - Action
        - Adventure
        - Role-Playing Games (RPG)
        - MMO
        - Simulation
        - Strategy
        - Sports
        - Puzzle

        - Battle Royale
        - Horror
        - Deck Builder
        - Idler / Idle Game
        - Clicker

  - **Single Genre**: 
        Games with a single genre are clearer but often less interesting because the space may already be well-explored.

  - **Genre Combinations**: 
        Combining genres can be risky, but can also lead to innovative gameplay, offering fresh angles on existing concepts.

  - **Vague Genre Statements**: 
        Avoid using vague comparisons, like "a Castlevania-like game," as they don't provide enough meaningful information about the game's design.

  - **"Something for Everyone" Pitfall**: 
        Games that try to mix too many genres risk becoming a disjointed experience, appealing to no one.
  
  - In doubt... **Define Genre and Flavor**: 
        Clearly define the game's genre using established classifications (e.g., sports, first-person shooter, puzzle, RPG, etc.).
    
-**Type or Game Modes**:

    - Singleplayer: Games designed for one player.
    - Multiplayer: Games that allow multiple players to participate simultaneously.
    - Local Area Network (LAN): Multiplayer mode where players connect on the same local network, often used for competitive gaming events.
    - Split-screen: Multiple players share the same screen, typically on a console, for local cooperative or competitive play.
    - Online Multiplayer: Players connect and interact over the internet, can be competitive or cooperative.
    - Cooperative (Co-op): Players work together to achieve common goals.
    - Competitive: Players compete against each other.
    - Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO): Large numbers of players interact in a shared online world.
    - Asynchronous Multiplayer: Players participate at different times, not simultaneously.
  
- **Development Scope**:
    Outline the overall scale and ambition of the project, including its timeline, team size, and potential risks.
