# Game Description


## Working Title
The game's title should be carefully considered and evaluated. Is it already in use by another game? Have you tested it with potential players through surveys or polls? The uniqueness of your title can be assessed by checking the number of Google search results it generates.

## Tag line
A tagline is a memorable phrase or statement that brands your game. Not all games have a tagline, and it may feel outdated in some cases. However, when it fits the genre and timing, it can be a powerful branding tool.

"**Gotta Catch 'Em All!**" – Pokémon

"**War. War Never Changes.**" – Fallout

## Platform and Engine
Describe the platforms the game will be released on (e.g., PC, consoles, mobile) and the technology or game engine (e.g., Unreal Engine, Unity) being used for development, explaining how these choices impact the game’s performance and accessibility.

## Visual Perspective
Define the game’s graphical style (2D, HD-2D, 3D, or 2.5D) and camera perspective (top-down, isometric, side-scrolling, first-person, third-person, or fixed-camera).

## Genre
You can look up Steam Primary Game Genre or [Wikipedia list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Video_game_genres):

- Action
- Adventure
- Role-Playing Games (RPG)
- MMO
- Simulation
- Strategy
- Sports

### Single Genre 
Games with a single genre are clearer but often less interesting because the space may already be well-explored.

### Genre Combinations
Combining genres can be risky, but can also lead to innovative gameplay, offering fresh angles on existing concepts.

### Vague Genre Statements
Avoid using vague comparisons, like "a Castlevania-like game," as they don't provide enough meaningful information about the game's design.

### "Something for Everyone" Pitfall
Games that try to mix too many genres risk becoming a disjointed experience, appealing to no one.
  
### In doubt... Define Genre and Flavor
Clearly define the game's genre using established classifications (e.g., sports, first-person shooter, puzzle, RPG, etc.).
