# Tech Analysis
The technical analysis should be written by a lead programmer or technical director and then edited into the proposal.

---

## Experimental Features

List features that are experimental, such as untried technologies or approaches. Exclude features already proven in other games, even if new to the team. For example, if your team is working on a 3D engine using an unproven method (e.g., quads), list it as experimental.

Estimate the time required to develop these features and bring them to evaluation. Experimental features often require more time, so they could extend the project timeline. Ensure the reviewers understand the value of these experiments.

---

## Major Development Tasks

Describe major development tasks in simple terms for non-technical readers. Include time estimates and required resources. For example:

- **AI Script Parser**: 3-4 months with two programmers to convert AI scripts into executable logic.

---

## Risks

Identify potential technical risks, including untried technologies or methods. If there are no risks, say so. For example, if your team has never worked on real-time strategy games or 3D rendering, list these as risks. Mention the impact on the schedule and resources required to resolve issues.

---

## Alternatives (If Any)

Offer alternatives to mitigate risks or experimental features. List options that might cost more or less but with different results. Include the pros and cons to help reviewers make informed decisions.

---

## Estimated Resources

List the resources needed: people, contractors, software, hardware. Use industry-standard titles for external readers (e.g., publishers or investors). Estimate work months or weeks, ignoring costs at this stage.

---

## Estimated Schedule

Provide the overall development duration and key milestones (e.g., start date, alpha, beta, and gold master).


---
## Cost and revenue projections

### Resource Cost

Resource costs are based on the estimated resources from the technical analysis. Employee costs should reflect salaries and overhead, as provided by the finance or payroll department. List hardware and software purchases, even if shared across projects or folded into overhead. Use tables or embedded spreadsheets for clarity. 

Additional costs may include licensing, contracting, or outsourced testing.

---

### Suggested Retail Price (SRP)

Recommend a target retail price based on existing game prices, the value being built into the product, and the development costs. Distributors may push for lower prices, but this should be handled later. Keep in mind that higher prices generally result in lower sales, especially in competitive genres with high supply.

---

### Revenue Projection

Project revenue under pessimistic, expected, and optimistic scenarios based on the costs outlined and the suggested retail price. Exclude marketing and company overhead unless a minimum marketing budget is known. Often, these projections are best shown in pie or bar charts, with additional indicators showing the impact of risks described in the technical analysis.
