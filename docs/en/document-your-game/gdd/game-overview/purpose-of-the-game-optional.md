# Purpose of the Game (optional)

Define the core goals the game aims to achieve, whether educational, training-related, or for social impact. This could include addressing specific problems, enhancing skill development, fostering creativity, promoting mental well-being, or even providing entertainment for relaxation or stress relief. It can also aim to engage users in awareness campaigns, promote teamwork, or serve as an immersive tool for learning complex concepts or simulations. Additionally, highlight how the game connects to current industry trends (e.g., the rise of social gaming or interactive storytelling) and provides an engaging experience for players. Consider including examples of similar successful games that have achieved similar goals, helping to demonstrate the potential effectiveness of your game's purpose.

## Intended Use

Detail how the game will be used in practical scenarios. Will it be a standalone game that players can engage with independently? Or will it be used as a supplement to traditional classroom learning, as a tool for workplace training, or in therapy and rehabilitation programs? In the game industry, it could also be designed for team-building activities, public health initiatives, or as part of e-learning courses, interactive storytelling experiences, or mental health treatment in therapeutic settings. Additionally, the game might cater to streaming platforms, where it serves as entertainment for streamers and their audiences, encouraging interaction, community-building, or content creation.

## Connection to Industry Trends

Mention how the purpose aligns with current trends in the gaming industry (e.g., the rise of mobile games, immersive VR experiences, or narrative-driven experiences) and how it can engage players within those trends.


## Justification for the Use

Provide evidence or research supporting the effectiveness of the chosen approach. Are there existing games or applications that have successfully employed similar methods or features? If the game is experimental, explain why the approach is believed to have potential, and highlight any previous successes or trends in the industry that suggest it could succeed in the intended use cases, whether for educational, training, therapeutic, or entertainment purposes.

## Success Cases

Provide examples of other successful games that have achieved similar purposes, whether in education, mental well-being, social impact, or entertainment. This could help validate the approach you're taking.
