# Core Gameplay

Define the main sequence of actions players repeat throughout the game (e.g., explore, collect, upgrade).

## Core Loop
The core loop represents the fundamental, repeatable actions that define moment-to-moment gameplay. It consists of:

- **Primary Action**: The main activity players perform repeatedly.
- **Immediate Feedback**: How the game responds to the player's actions.
- **Short-term Goal**: What players aim to achieve through these actions.

Example:
>*"Players continuously cycle through: 1 Locate enemies, 2 Aim and shoot, 3 Collect dropped items. Each successful hit provides visual and audio feedback, with kills rewarding experience points."*

## Level Loop
The level loop focuses on the structure and flow of individual game segments or stages. It includes:

- **Level Objectives**: The specific goals players must achieve in each level.
- **Obstacles and Challenges**: What players must overcome to complete the level.
- **Rewards**: What players gain upon level completion.

Example: 
>*"Each level presents a unique grid-based puzzle. Players must connect all nodes within a time limit. Completing a level awards stars (1-3) based on speed and moves used, unlocking new level packs."*

## Meta Loop
The meta loop encompasses the overall game progression and long-term player engagement. It typically includes:

- **Character/Player Progression**: How the player's avatar or abilities improve over time.
- **Unlocking New Content**: The process of revealing new game elements as the player advances.
- **Overarching Narrative**: The main storyline or campaign that ties the game together.

Example: 
>*"Players will progress through 5 main story chapters, each unlocking new abilities and areas to explore. Character levels range from 1-50, with new skill trees unlocked every 10 levels."*

## Core Mechanics
Core mechanics are the fundamental interactions that define your game. They should support the emotional drive of your game and be present throughout the entire experience. Examples include:
- **Platformers**: Jumping and movement.
- **First-Person Shooters**: Aiming and shooting.
- **Strategy Games**: Resource management and unit control.
- **RPGs**: Character progression and skill development.

# Gameplay Flow
The Gameplay Flow should provide a detailed, step-by-step description of player actions, including how they interact with the game world, progress through challenges, and impact the narrative. It should outline the evolving difficulty, core gameplay extensions, and the integration of UI elements, such as menus and HUD, that enhance the experience. Additionally, explain how immediate outcomes and long-term consequences of player decisions shape the gameâ€™s progression and player engagement.
