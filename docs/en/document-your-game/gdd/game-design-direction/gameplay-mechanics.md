## Core Gameplay

**Core Gameplay Loop**
Define the main sequence of actions players repeat throughout the game (e.g., explore, collect, upgrade).

**Core Gameplay Elements**
Identify the key gameplay mechanics that define the core experience, such as speed, action, turn-based mechanics, or strategic elements. 

**Gameplay Flow**
The Gameplay Flow should provide a detailed, step-by-step description of player actions, including how they interact with the game world, progress through challenges, and impact the narrative. It should outline the evolving difficulty, core gameplay extensions, and the integration of UI elements, such as menus and HUD, that enhance the experience. Additionally, explain how immediate outcomes and long-term consequences of player decisions shape the game’s progression and player engagement.

## Player Challenges and Progression

**Difficulty and Accessibility**

- **Difficulty Options (optional)**:
Describe how your game offers scalable challenges to accommodate players with different skill levels. For example, you might include options like easy, normal, and hard modes, or features such as aim assist, visual aids, or other tools that enhance accessibility for diverse player needs.

- **Difficulty Scale**:
Outline how the difficulty in your game evolves over time. This could involve aspects like increasing enemy difficulty, puzzle complexity, or level challenges. You might also describe how players progress, such as through leveling up, unlocking abilities, or reaching key story milestones. Consider how these systems interact with the difficulty options or accessibility features you’ve included.

- **Visual and Audio Assist Options**:
Include tools like subtitles or colorblind modes.

**Progression Systems**
Explain how players advance through the game (e.g., leveling up, unlocking skills).

**Obectif and/or Objectives**

- **Main Objective**:
Describe the single overarching goal of the game that drives the narrative and gameplay.
- **Objectives (Optional)**: 
Provide an outline for any additional goals players may pursue, such as side missions or secondary tasks.

**Player Motivation**
Explain why achieving these objectives is engaging and meaningful to the player.

Example: 
>*"Saving the kingdom offers a sense of heroism, while completing side objectives rewards players with unique abilities and deeper immersion in the world."*

### Replayability Factors

**Procedural Generation**:
Include random or dynamic content to keep the game fresh.

**Multiple Endings or Paths**:
Provide branching narratives or player-driven outcomes.

**New Game+ Features**:
Enhance replay value with additional challenges or unlocks after the first playthrough.

**Saving System**:
Outline how players can save their progress, load saved games, and replay the game, including autosave and manual save options.

## Interaction Systems

**Combat or Interaction Systems (if main part of your game)**
Short description of player-enemy interactions, or non-combat engagement like puzzles or diplomacy.

**Player Actions and Controls**

**Movements**:
- Describe how players move their character within the game world (e.g., walking, running, crouching).
- Specify input methods (e.g., WASD or arrow keys for keyboard, joystick for gamepad).
- Include any special movement mechanics (e.g., climbing, sliding, swimming, dashing).

**Jumping**:
- Outline how players make the character jump, including any additional control inputs for height or distance (e.g., holding the jump button for a higher jump).
- Specify any unique mechanics (e.g., double jump, wall jumping).

**Attacking**:
- Detail how players perform attacks, whether melee (e.g., sword slashing) or ranged (e.g., shooting).
- Describe the controls for initiating attacks, including any combos or special attack mechanics.
- Include input variations based on different weapons or abilities (e.g., pressing a different button for a ranged weapon versus a melee weapon).

**Interacting**:
- Define the actions for interacting with objects or NPCs (e.g., pressing a button to open doors, talk to NPCs, pick up items).
- Specify any contextual interaction (e.g., pressing a button when near a specific object to trigger a unique action).

**Special Abilities or Powers**:
- List any special abilities the character has (e.g., magic spells, stealth mode, shields).
- Describe how these abilities are activated (e.g., holding a button or selecting from a menu).
- Detail any cooldowns, resource management, or energy systems associated with these abilities.

**Camera Controls**:
- If applicable, explain how players control the camera (e.g., using the mouse or right joystick).
- Outline whether the camera is fixed, first-person, or third-person, and how it responds to player movement or actions.

**Additional Actions**:
- Include any other unique actions that the player can perform, such as crafting, solving puzzles, using gadgets, or interacting with the environment in specific ways.
- Specify the control inputs for these actions and how they contribute to gameplay.
  
**Cheats and Easter Egg**
- Mention any cheat codes or Easter eggs that players can discover, enhancing replayability or adding fun, non-essential content.

### Interaction Structure

**Dialogue Structure**:
Specify how dialogue branching structures are designed and implemented (e.g., as dialogue trees, state machines, or scriptable objects). Include details on input methods for interacting with dialogue (e.g., selection wheels or text-based menus). Mention how the system accounts for context, such as dynamic responses based on player choices or world states.

**Choice and Consequence**:
Detail how player decisions impact gameplay elements like objectives, allies, or resource availability. Explain the framework for mapping narrative decisions to gameplay outcomes (e.g., decision trees, flag-based systems, or event-driven triggers). Describe how player choices persist across levels or save files, and how branching paths affect variables like quest progression, ally availability, or environmental changes.

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**:
Describe if NPCs will move based on pathfinding, avoid obstacles, or make combat decisions like targeting and positioning. Explain if they will react to player actions or environmental changes, such as responding to noise or being ambushed. Indicate if their behavior adapts to the game’s difficulty. Specify if level designers can control these behaviors through configuration files, scripts, or other methods. Also, mention if roles like quest-givers, merchants, or enemies are programmed to support the game’s story and gameplay.


**Resource Management**:
Detail systems involving collection and utilization of resources (e.g., inventory, crafting).

### UI/Game Controls

**User Interface (UI) Design**: Provide a detailed description of the in-game UI, including the HUD, menus, inventory system, and how players interact with these elements.

**Control Scheme**: Define how players control the game, including button layouts for various platforms (keyboard/mouse, gamepad). Highlight key actions and input mappings.

**Accessibility Features in Controls**: Specify any customizable controls or assistive features such as remapping buttons, alternative control schemes for players with disabilities, or adaptive devices.

**Functional Requirements**: Define a breakdown of every screen, window, and menu, detailing user actions and the desired results. Include actions like button clicks, sliders, and interactions, and consider providing diagrams and mock-ups. Describe how interactions will evolve during implementation and how they relate to the technical specifications.

**Flowchart of UI Navigation**: Create a flowchart that illustrates the navigation through various screens, windows, and menus. Use a tool like Visio or similar to connect labeled and numbered boxes that represent the different elements of the interface. This helps visualize the player's journey and task flow.

**GUI Objects**: List all GUI objects that need to be programmed, including buttons, icons, sliders, HUD components, and other interactive elements. Provide a description of how each element behaves and how the player interacts with them. Include any specifics regarding their function in the game and their behavior when clicked or activated.
