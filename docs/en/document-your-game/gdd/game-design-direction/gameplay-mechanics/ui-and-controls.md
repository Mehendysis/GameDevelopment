# UI & Controls

## User Interface (UI) Design 
Provide a detailed description of the in-game UI, including the HUD, menus, inventory system, and how players interact with these elements.

## Control Scheme*
Define how players control the game, including button layouts for various platforms (keyboard/mouse, gamepad). Highlight key actions and input mappings.

## Accessibility Features in Controls
Specify any customizable controls or assistive features such as remapping buttons, alternative control schemes for players with disabilities, or adaptive devices.

## Functional Requirements
Define a breakdown of every screen, window, and menu, detailing user actions and the desired results. Include actions like button clicks, sliders, and interactions, and consider providing diagrams and mock-ups. Describe how interactions will evolve during implementation and how they relate to the technical specifications.

## Flowchart of UI Navigation
Create a flowchart that illustrates the navigation through various screens, windows, and menus. Use a tool like Visio or similar to connect labeled and numbered boxes that represent the different elements of the interface. This helps visualize the player's journey and task flow.

## GUI Objects
List all GUI objects that need to be programmed, including buttons, icons, sliders, HUD components, and other interactive elements. Provide a description of how each element behaves and how the player interacts with them. Include any specifics regarding their function in the game and their behavior when clicked or activated.

## Settings and Customization Options
List the settings that players can customize, including graphical options, sound preferences, input methods, and any other preferences. Describe how these settings are accessed via the UI and how they affect gameplay.

## Mock-ups
Include simple mock-ups/screenshots for all screens, menus, and windows, even if the final design is not yet available. These should be basic line drawings or wireframes that help communicate the vision for the UI. Avoid creating polished artwork at this stage; focus on clarity and functionality. This will be given to the Art Director to use and perfect in the Game Art Document by artists.

## Text and Onscreen Messages
Define all onscreen text messages, including tutorial hints, error messages, and notifications. Describe their general format, style, and behavior. Explain how these messages interact with the player, including timing, triggers, and visibility.
