# Design Pillars
Design pillars are fundamental principles or key elements that guide the development of a game. 
They serve as the foundation for all decisions made during the game's design and development, ensuring a cohesive vision.
A pillar would be composed of a word, a concise phrase or a statement that encapsulate a core idea, emotion, or mechanic that the game should embody. 

## Number of Design Pillars
 3 to 5 pillars are ideal to avoid dilution of focus or underdevelopment of important aspects.

## Design Pillars Can Cover
- Gameplay Mechanics
- Narrative and Storytelling
- Art and Aesthetic
- Player Experience and Accessibility
- Emotion and Atmosphere
- Innovation or Unique Selling Point (USP)
- Replayability and Longevity

>
> *Thrill of the Unknown:*
>>*Excitement, dread and tension of exploring the unknown. No idea what dangers/rewards are down there.*
>
> *Cascading Hysteria:*
>>*Uncontrollable outburst of emotion, fear, irrationality, laughter, weeping, etc. FTL style chain of "oh sh!t" dependencies, where a failure in one system can affect others, until you're suddenly in trouble.*
