**Font and Typography**:  
Detail how the game will handle different character sets (e.g., Latin, Cyrillic, CJK) and any required font adjustments to ensure readability.

**Audio Localization**:  
Include details about voiceover support for different languages, such as dubbing, accents, or subtitles synchronized with speech.

**Cultural Adaptations**:  
Note any necessary changes to art, symbols, or themes to maintain cultural sensitivity and relevance in different regions.

**UI Adjustments for Localization**:  
Address how the UI will handle variable text lengths, right-to-left languages, or unique formatting (e.g., dates, numbers). Ensure layout consistency and usability across all languages.

**Testing and QA**:  
Outline plans for region-specific quality assurance processes to catch issues like truncated text, misaligned elements, or incorrect translations.
