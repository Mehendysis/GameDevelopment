# Level Design

Levels can be designed to introduce new skills, mechanics, and challenges, gradually increasing in complexity. Each level may feature distinct gameplay and content changes that help the player learn and master new aspects of the game.

---

## Level Structure and Progression (if applicable)
Each level could be used to introduce new objectives, environments, and gameplay elements:

- **Skills & Information**: What new abilities or knowledge does the player gain in each level?
- **Synopsis & Objectives**: A brief summary of the level and its goals, including how the gameplay or content changes. Some levels may introduce fewer hints or more enemies as the player progresses.
- **Map Design**: Whether the level is handcrafted or procedurally generated, detailing any constraints and changes to the environment.
- **Training/Tutorial**: Is there a dedicated training level or playable tutorial for the player to learn the basics? If your game includes a help or tutorial system, describe its structure. Detail how it is presented to the player, such as through tooltips, in-game prompts, or contextual assistance. Include information about how it helps players navigate the game and interface.

## Player Progression

- **Level Completion**: How is the player's progress evaluated at the end of the level?
- **Replayability**: Are players allowed to replay levels? Does progression unlock new levels based on achievement?
- **Unlockable Levels**: Does progression require a specific level of accomplishment in previous levels to unlock subsequent levels? If so, outline how the progression system works.

## Level Requirements

- **Level Diagram**: A roadmap for the game's level structure, whether linear, branching, or open-world. This helps visualize how levels are connected and how players progress.

- **Asset Revelation Schedule**: A table or chart showing when new assets (e.g., power-ups, enemies, objectives) are introduced in each level. This ensures assets are revealed at the right time and are not overused.
  
- **Level Design Seeds**: Initial ideas for level design, focusing on gameplay goals, difficulty, and where the level fits within the story. Detailed designs may evolve after experimentation with tools and prototyping.

- **Environment and Thematic Consistency**: Does the environment change in terms of aesthetics, enemies, and gameplay mechanics as the player moves through different levels? Each level should maintain a thematic consistency, while also introducing enough new elements to keep the experience fresh.

## World Design

**World Structure**:
Define the overall structure of the game, such as whether it’s level-based, chapter-based, or open-world. Specify how the game progresses (e.g., linear levels, episodic chapters, or free exploration in an open-world setup). Clarify if the game has distinct levels or chapters that players must complete in sequence, or if the structure supports non-linear progression with branching paths.

**Exploration Mechanics**:
Highlight how players interact with and explore the environment, including traversal mechanics (e.g., walking, flying, vehicle use) and any interactive elements like unlocking new areas or discovering hidden locations.

**Gameplay Elements**:
 Define all interactive elements within the game that the player or characters/units can engage with or acquire. This includes items such as weapons, buildings, switches, elevators, traps, spells, power-ups, and special talents. For each category, explain how these elements are introduced into the game and how players interact with them. Clarify how each element contributes to gameplay mechanics and the player’s progression within the game world.

**Economy** (if applicable):
Detail the game's resource system, how items are earned or lost, and if applicable, how the in-game economy operates (e.g., currency, trading, or item crafting).
