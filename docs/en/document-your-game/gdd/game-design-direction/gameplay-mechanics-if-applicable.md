# Gameplay Mechanics (if applicable)
This section covers features that may be optional or supplementary, depending on the focus of your game. If one of these mechanics is a central part of your game (e.g., crafting, multiplayer), please provide a detailed explanation of how it functions and contributes to the overall experience.

## Multiplayer Features (if applicable)

**Multiplayer Modes**:
Define the different types of multiplayer gameplay, such as:
- Head-to-head
- Cooperative vs. AI
- Teams (with team mechanics)
- Every man for himself
- Hotseat (turn-based multiplayer where players share the same device)  

Specify the number of players supported in each mode and the mode’s focus (e.g., teamwork, player vs. player, open world interaction).

**Cooperative or Competitive Modes**:
Describe how players interact with each other within the game:
- Combat, trading, or collaboration
- Whether interactions are direct (e.g., combat between players) or mediated through in-game systems (e.g., messages, emotes, team mechanics)

**Matchmaking and Party Systems**:  
Outline the system for matchmaking or forming teams:
- Criteria for pairing players (e.g., skill level, geographic region)
- Group formation tools (e.g., party creation, clan systems, or random matchmaking)

**Player Communication Mechanics**:  
Describe in-game communication and interactions between players, including:
- Text chat, voice chat, or emotes
- Team-specific communication or open chat

**Online Features and Connectivity**:  
Highlight online play capabilities and requirements:
- Local or online multiplayer
- Peer-to-peer or client-server architecture
- Network requirements and player latency considerations

**Differences from Solo-Play**:  
Explain how multiplayer differs from solo-play in the following areas:
- **Game Flow**: How the pacing, objectives, or progression changes when multiple players are involved.
- **Characters/Units**: Whether the multiplayer mode introduces new characters/units or players control existing ones in a new context.
- **Gameplay Elements**: Unique mechanics in multiplayer (e.g., co-op mechanics, competitive features, shared objectives).
- **AI Adjustments**: How AI behaves differently in multiplayer (e.g., AI might be less aggressive or have different priorities compared to solo play).

## Game Physics (if applicable)

**Collision Physics**: 
Define how characters and objects move in the game world (e.g., walking, running, sliding) and how collisions with other objects, surfaces, or characters are handled, factoring in statistics like speed or mass.

**Combat Physics**:
Describe how combat interactions (e.g., melee or ranged attacks) are physically modeled, including the impact of weapon types, character stats, and enemy defenses, ensuring realistic consequences for player actions.

**Environmental Effects on Movement**:
Explain how environmental factors (e.g., hills, water, or terrain) affect movement, with adjustments based on player or character attributes like speed, climbing ability, or resistance to obstacles.

**Physics Balance**:
Discuss how the balance of game physics will ensure a fair and engaging experience without causing performance issues, keeping it high-level and avoiding overly technical details for programmers to handle.

## Customization (if applicable)
This section details player personalization options, procedural world adjustments, and crafting mechanics. It provides a foundation for creating systems that enhance player agency and gameplay depth.

**Player Customization**
- **Appearance**: Identify the objects or classes needed to support visual modifications (e.g., character models, texture assets for clothing or accessories) and the system for applying those changes dynamically during gameplay.
- **Abilities and Skills**: Define the structures for skill trees and abilities. This includes creating skill progression graphs, defining available skills, and how players unlock and upgrade them based on specific conditions (e.g., experience points, quests). Consider how these abilities interact with gameplay mechanics and affect player strategies.
- **Equipment and Loadouts**: Establish a system for equipping players with weapons, armor, or tools, and how these interact with gameplay. Establish classes for weapons, armor, and tools. Consider their properties (e.g., damage, durability, effects) and how these interact with combat, defense, and the environment. Define processes for equipping and managing these items during gameplay.

## Spawning system (if applicable)

**Mob and NPC Spawning**
- **NPC Spawning Systems**: Specify the system for dynamic NPC generation, whether it’s procedural, event-based, or rule-driven. Outline how NPCs will spawn based on world conditions (e.g., player progression, area-specific events) and the logic for NPC placement, behavior, and interaction.
- **Behavior and Role Assignments**: NPC behaviors, such as aggressiveness or roles (e.g., healer, merchant). Design NPC behavior systems (e.g., AI states, roles like merchant or quest giver) and how they affect player interaction and world events.
- **Coportment and Role Variations**: Develop systems for adjusting NPC roles or behaviors based on game state changes or player actions (e.g., NPCs switching from neutral to hostile).
 
**Procedual Game World and Environment Customization**
- **Terrain and Base Building**: Outline the system for terrain modification or base building, including the objects or classes needed to modify, destroy, or build environmental elements.
- **World Creation Rules**: Discuss systems for tweaking environmental settings such as difficulty, resource distribution, weather effects, or day-night cycles.
- **Procedual Generation**: Detail how procedural algorithms determine terrain layouts, resource placements, event spawns, and world dynamics, ensuring a unique experience with each playthrough.

---

## Crafting Systems (if applicable)

- **Core Crafting Mechanics**: Outline how players collect resources to craft items, weapons, tools, or structures.
- **Crafting Recipes**: Include details on how players learn recipes (e.g., through progression, discovery, or blueprints).
- **Customizable Output**: Allow players to modify crafted items, such as enhancing stats or aesthetics.
- **Dynamic Crafting**: Explain how crafting integrates with procedural systems, like randomly generating unique crafting materials or recipe variations based on the game world’s state.
- **Crafting Stations and Tools**: Specify whether players require designated crafting areas or tools to create items, adding an extra layer of strategy to resource management.

## Platform-Specific Features (if applicable)

**Use of Unique Hardware Capabilities**:
Detail features utilizing platform-specific tools (e.g., motion controls, haptics).

**Cross-Platform Functionality**:
Explain how players interact across devices or systems.
