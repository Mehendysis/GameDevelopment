# GDD-Draft (Game Design Document)

The GDD-Draft serves to quickly create a demo to test if your abstract idea holds together. The draft is meant to be a short and flexible version before transitioning to a more static GDD. *You can't polish a piece of sh!t until it becomes gold. No matter how much polish you apply, it will still be sh!t and not all that glitthers is gold;*. It needs to start with solid workable foundations.

## Starting your doc

#1 Main mechanics of the MVP*

*Minimum viable product: A testable version with (only one) the most important mechanic of the game, a begining and an end. Without anything else to remove.
"Perfection is achieved when there is nothing left to take away" -Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry. 
Perfection is not the reason why, you just need the quickest way to showcase you design so that it can be tested by a potential client from A to Z.
The MVP acronym is to be used among stakholders but the name of the resulting version for the consumers will be called the Demo.

If you have an artist he should start the promo art. But to start the promo art you need to settle the main art direction of the game in the GDD draft.

Define the core game loop, it needs a beggining, a main mechanic playthrough and an end.
-If you make an online game you need to start with the lobby.
-If the main mechanic does revolve around fighting ennemies, there shouldn't be any ennemies yet.

## Game Overview
To have a concise version of what needs to be done in the first version of the *MVP demo* only one part of the *Game Overview* section should be filled:

- [Game Description](/GameDevelopment/GDD/game-overview/game-description/)

## Game Design Direction
Thw direction of the game design cannot be competly secured yet, this is where we have to test and go back redifining the GDD-Draft as much as possible to get the right mechanics before going further. The only needed sections for now are in the *Gameplay Mechanics* section.

### Gameplay Mecanics

- [Core Gameplay](/GameDevelopment/GDD/game-design-direction/gameplay-mechanics/core-gameplay/)
- [Interactions](/GameDevelopment/GDD/game-design-direction/gameplay-mechanics/interactions/)

### Gameplay Mechanics (if applicable)
If your game's core mechanic (such as crafting) appears in this list, consider including it in your GDD-Draft. For the MVP, minimize the number of mechanics - ideally focus on one primary mechanic supported by a few basic secondary mechanics. These secondary mechanics should serve as placeholders that complement the main mechanic. For example, in the GDD-Draft of Mechatriarch, combat serves as the primary mechanic, while spawning and crafting function as supporting placeholder mechanics that enhance the combat system.
