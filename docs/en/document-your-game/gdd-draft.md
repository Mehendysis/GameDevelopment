#1 Main mechanics of the MVP*

*Minimum viable product: A testable version with (only one) the most important mechanic of the game, a begining and an end. Without anything else to remove.
"Perfection is achieved when there is nothing left to take away" -Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry. 
Perfection is not the reason why, you just need the quickest way to showcase you design so that it can be tested by a potential client from A to Z.
The MVP acronym is to be used among stakholders but the name of the resulting version for the consumers will be called the Demo.

If you have an artist he should start the promo art. But to start the promo art you need to settle the main art direction of the game in the GDD draft.

Define the core game loop, it needs a beggining, a main mechanic playthrough and an end.
-If you make an online game you need to start with the lobby.
-If the main mechanic does revolve around fighting ennemies, there shouldn't be any ennemies yet.
