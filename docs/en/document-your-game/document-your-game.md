# Document Your Game

Game designers create and maintain the Game Design Document (GDD) to outline the game's vision, collaborating with developers who reference it to create the Technical Design Document (TDD), ensuring technical implementation aligns with the intended design, while artists and other team members use the GDD to guide their work.

The Game Design Document (GDD), GDD-Draft, and other design documents typically consist of concise descriptions for each section, often ranging from a single sentence to a few sentences. If a particular section is not relevant to your game, you may omit it entirely. Detailed elaborations on the elements mentioned in these documents are generally reserved for technical documents, such as the Technical Design Document (TDD).
