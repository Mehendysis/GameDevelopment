# Document Your Game

Game designers create and maintain the Game Design Document (GDD) to outline the game's vision, collaborating with developers who reference it to create the Technical Design Document (TDD), ensuring technical implementation aligns with the intended design, while artists and other team members use the GDD to guide their work.
