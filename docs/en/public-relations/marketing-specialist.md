#### **Analyzing the Competition**  
   - **Identify Competitors**: Look for similar games in your genre or niche. This can include indie hits and larger titles that influence your audience's preferences.  
   - **Assess Strengths and Weaknesses**: What makes those games successful? Where do they fall short?  
   - **Compare Pricing and Monetization**: Study how competitors price their games, use DLCs, or integrate in-app purchases.  
   - **Community Interaction**: Observe how competitors engage with their audience. What social media platforms, forums, or events do they prioritize?  

#### **Identifying Market Trends**  
   - Stay updated on trends within your genre or niche. Are there particular themes, mechanics, or art styles gaining popularity?
